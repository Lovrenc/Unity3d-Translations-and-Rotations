# Unity3d-Translations-and-Rotations
Implements a simple movement of a square in Unity3d and was used for the following [article](https://medium.com/@lovro.gregorcic/surface-look-at-transformations-in-unity3d-3ebeaaab773d).
    
The project contains two scripts. 

In one script, we split the movement and implement it by using basic trigonometry.
The second script implements the same movement but uses a single Unity3d Transform function.
